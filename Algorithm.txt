Algorithm:

Step 1: INITALIZATION
	points=0
	top=-1
	max=10
	i=9	

step 2:	STORING QUESTION AND ANSWER

	construct 2D array name stackQ of sixe10*256
	Initalize the stack with questions of decreasing difficulty such that easiest question is pushed last to pop first.	
	Push answer into the array name stackAns.
	
Step 3: 
	print "Welcome"
	scan name.
	
Step 4:	
		print stackQ[i]
		scan ans
		if (ans=stackAns[i])
			points=points+(10-i)*10
			print "correct"

		else if(ans=0)
			print "You quit"

		else
			print "Correct answer is %d",stackAns
			points = points -50
			break
		
Step 4:
	i--
	if(i>=0)
		goto STEP 4

Step 5:	
	print points

Step 6:END.
